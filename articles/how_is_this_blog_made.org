This blog is written in Org, on the magnificent VIM text editor.

It is compiled by [[https://git.gnous.eu/wafelack/website/src/branch/master/make_article.rb][a Ruby script]], which is a pseudo SSG that is just translating Org to HTML with a link to a 10-lines-long CSS file.

Obviously, this site does not use any Javascript code and is available freely (as in freedom) at [[https://git.gnous.eu/wafelack/website][git.gnous.eu/wafelack/website]].
