        <h1>Why is VIM one of the best text editors</h1>
        <p><i>16 April 2021 - Edited 17 July 2021</i></p>
        <p>In this post, I will explain why VIM is one of the best text editors in my opinion.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>VIM is ergonomic and powerful . I mean, <i>really</i> ergonomic. You don&#8217;t need to move your fingers everywhere on your keyboard to do a small thing, all the keybindings are grouped around the <b>home-row</b>, therefore you can leave your hands at the same place during your whole editing session. You don&#8217;t need to type monstruous keybindings like <code>Ctrl + Shift + =</code>. Moreover, the mode system allows you to do loads of things with a few keys. Its power also comes with macros and its scripting language.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>VIM is <b>definitely NOT</b> difficult to use, but only if you know how to read, if you don&#8217;t, I encourage you to <a href="https://www.learnreading.com/">learn</a>.
                <p>Seriously, the meme « LMAO I&#8217;m trying to exit VIM since 4 years » is just stupid as the information is written on the start page (yes, try running the <code>intro</code> command or running VIM without any options, and you&#8217;ll see).</p>
                <p>When you install VIM, you also install the <code>vimtutor</code>, which is a complete tutorial on how to use VIM, and it is translated in dozens of languages (<code>vimtutor &lt;language_code&gt;</code>). Then, if you find a new command and don&#8217;t understand it, just run <code>:help &lt;command&gt;</code>, and you&#8217;ll get a detailed help.</p>
                <p>If you want to learn « advanced » things such as VimL, to populate your <code>.vimrc</code> or to write plugins, you can use this <a href="https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com">great course by Steve Losh</a>.</p>
                <p>TL;DR: VIM is complex, but not uneasy.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>VIM is really light. Both in features, disk space or memory usage. It does not use Electron or run Chromium instances and doesn&#8217;t come out of the box with a web browser (I&#8217;m not aiming to anybody) nor a Git client. If you&#8217;re missing a feature, it is almost surely covered by one of the thousands of plugins made by the VIM community.</li>
        </ul>
